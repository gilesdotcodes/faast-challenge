##General Comments

- Wallet + Ticket Machine are outside of the original spec (but very cool!) 



##Bugs

- Train can't arrive at station, and station has no array, so can't store trains.
  - So, passangers can be added to trains anywhere in the system
- Person can be added to a station mutliple times (which duplicates it)


##Refactoring

- Station's 'allow_entry' method's name isn't clear (it also denies entry as well as allows)
- Testing using London doubles?
